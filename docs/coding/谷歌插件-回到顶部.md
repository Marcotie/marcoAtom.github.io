### Why write this extension

Recently I read lots of long articles on chrome, sometimes when i find some interests i would like "ok, I will back here later", then scroll down, down, when I down enough and try to back to "the interesting parts", I have to scroll up very closely in case miss it.

and also some website don't have `back to top` or `go to bottom` those features, which is also better to have.

### How I start

As a software engineer, I'm faimliar with `javascript`, which is the language to build a extension. so all I need is a handbook.

* https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted

After follow this tutorial a day, I'm build the extension:
* `back to top` and `go to bottom` button
* `pin` button, when clicked, it will store current position, then you can go anywhere, another click will bring you back here.
